## Overview

Ex-sRNA-NF processes single-end small RNA sequencing data from extracellular fractions across multiple species in a single run. The pipeline performs adapter trimming, genome alignment, size distribution profiling, competitive alignment to a combined per-organism annotation index, and fractional feature-type quantification with alpha and beta diversity reporting.

The pipeline is designed around the principle of **competitive alignment**. All sRNA feature FASTAs for a given organism (miRNA, hairpin, cDNA, tRNA, rRNA, etc.) are merged into a single labeled index before alignment. This allows read alignments to compete across all feature types simultaneously, producing unbiased fractional counts and meaningful diversity estimates.

- **Storage**: ~50 GB per organism for genome indices; plan for 2–5× the size of your raw data for intermediate files

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/exRNA-NF.git
cd exRNA-NF
```

### 2. Install Nextflow

```bash
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
mv nextflow ~/bin/   # or any directory on your $PATH
nextflow self-update
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Using conda (recommended for local):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate exRNA-nf
```

Or using mamba client for a faster resolve:

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate exRNA-nf
```

### 4. Verify installation

```bash
nextflow run main_sRNA.nf --help
```
## Deployment

The pipeline can be run directly on a host system with all dependencies installed
(see [Requirements](#requirements) and [Installation](#installation)), or inside
a self-contained Docker container that bundles all dependencies into a portable
image. Docker is recommended for cluster environments and to guarantee reproducibility in deployments accross different systems.

### Building the Docker image

A `Dockerfile` is provided in the repository root. Build the image from the
repository directory:
```bash
docker build -t exRNA-nf:1.0.0 .
```

The image installs all dependencies defined in `environment.yml` at build time. Build time is approximately 10–20
minutes on first run.

### Running the pipeline in a container

Input data and output directories on the host machine are mounted into the
container at runtime using `-v`. The pipeline reads and writes through these
mount points so all results appear on the host filesystem as normal:
```bash
DATA_DIR=/path/to/project_root

docker run --rm \
    -v ${DATA_DIR}/input:pipeline/input \
    -v ${DATA_DIR}/genome:/pipeline/genome \
    -v ${DATA_DIR}/results:/pipeline/results \
    -v ${DATA_DIR}/work:/pipeline/work \
    --cpus 36 \
    --memory 128g \
    exRNA-nf:latest \
    nextflow run main_sRNA.nf \
        -c nextflow.config \
        -resume
```

        └── Gga_GRCg7b_cDNA.fa
```

### Naming convention

Library FASTQ files need to follow the pattern `<OrganismPrefix>_<...>.fastq.gz` where `<OrganismPrefix>` is the first `_`-delimited token and should match the start of the corresponding genome directory name. For example:

| FASTQ prefix | Matches genome directory |
|---|---|
| `Col0_` | `Ath_TAIR10/` (via `Col0` → genome name starts with organism code) |
| `Gma_` | `Gma_Wm82v4/` |
| `Zma_` | `Zma_B73v5/` |

> The matching logic in `main_sRNA.nf` uses `sample_id.startsWith(libPrefix)` — ensure prefixes are consistent between library filenames and genome directory names.

### Annotation FASTAs

Pre-computed annotation FASTAs (`*_miRNA.fa`, `*_hairpin.fa`, `*_TAS.fa`, `*_TE.fa`, `*_cDNA.fa`) should be placed in the genome directory alongside the genome FASTA. The tRNA and rRNA FASTAs are generated automatically by the pipeline using tRNAscan-SE and barrnap respectively.

Feature type labels in the combined index are derived directly from FASTA filenames by stripping the organism prefix and `.fa` suffix:

```
Col0_TAIR10_miRNA.fa  →  feature label: miRNA
Col0_TAIR10_tRNA.fa   →  feature label: tRNA
Col0_TAIR10_TE.fa     →  feature label: TE
```

## Parameters

All parameters are defined in `nextflow.config` and can be overridden at the command line with `--parameter value`.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `reads` | `exRNA_Species/*_sRNA/*fastq.gz` | Glob pattern for input FASTQ files |
| `genomes` | `genome/*/*_genome.fa` | Glob pattern for reference genome FASTAs |
| `genomes_dirs` | `genome/*` | Glob pattern for genome directories |
| `outdir` | `results/` | Output directory |
| `min_length` | `10` | Minimum read length after trimming (nt) |
| `max_length` | `50` | Maximum read length after trimming (nt) |
| `mismatches` | `0` | Mismatches allowed in annotation alignment |
| `max_feature_types` | `10` | Max alignments reported per read by bowtie2 (`-k`); should exceed number of feature types |
| `w_seg` | `null` | Comma-separated segment tokens for per-group Whittaker beta (see below) |
| `exclude_prefix` | `null` | Comma-separated library name prefixes to exclude from analysis |

### `--w_seg` — segmented Whittaker beta diversity

Calculates Whittaker beta diversity separately for subsets of samples defined by strings in their library names. Pipe-separated values within a token are treated as aliases for the same group.

```bash
# Calculate Whittaker beta striated by tissue or sample origin
> **Note:** 
nextflow run main_sRNA.nf --w_seg "AWF,CL,LSW|LSF"
```
> **Note:** Assumes this information is present in, and consistent accross file names. The pipe operator can be used to group synonymous or biologically relevant samples in the same segmentation. Make sure such a grouping is grounded in the your biological question!

Output in `all_samples_beta_diversity.tsv`:

```
whittaker_beta_global     0.2168    93
whittaker_beta_AWF        0.1832    31
whittaker_beta_CL         0.1544    28
whittaker_beta_LSW|LSF    0.2011    34
```

### `--exclude_prefix` — exclude sample libraries

Excludes libraries whose filenames start with any of the specified prefixes. Useful for excluding organisms from analysis without modifying the reads glob expression.

```bash
nextflow run main_sRNA.nf --exclude_prefix "Aco"
```

---

## Running the pipeline

### Basic run

```bash
cd /path/to/project_root
nextflow run Ex-sRNA-NF/main_sRNA.nf \
    -c Ex-sRNA-NF/nextflow.config
```

### Resume after failure or interruption

```bash
nextflow run Ex-sRNA-NF/main_sRNA.nf \
    -c Ex-sRNA-NF/nextflow.config \
    -resume
```

### Full run with all options

```bash
nextflow run Ex-sRNA-NF/main_sRNA.nf \
    -c Ex-sRNA-NF/nextflow.config \
    -with-dag dag.mmd \
    -with-trace \
    -with-report execution_report.html \
    --w_seg "AWF,CL,LSW|LSF" \
    --exclude_prefix "Aco" \
    -resume
```

### SLURM cluster

Modify for the institution profile in `nextflow.config`:

```nextflow
profiles {
    slurm {
        process.executor       = 'slurm'
        process.clusterOptions = '--account=<your_account>'
    }
}
```

Then run with:

```bash
nextflow run Ex-sRNA-NF/main_sRNA.nf \
    -c Ex-sRNA-NF/nextflow.config \
    -profile slurm \
    -resume
```

### Cleaning up work directories

After a successful run, remove intermediate files to recover disk space while preserving the most recent cached results:

```bash
nextflow clean -keep-last -f
```

To remove all work directories entirely:

```bash
rm -rf work/ .nextflow/ .nextflow.log
```

## Diversity metrics

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/infographic.png" alt="Diversity Metrics" width=100%/>
</p>

### Alpha diversity (within-sample)

| Metric | Formula | Range | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shannon H | −Σ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ) | 0 → log₂(n) | Overall diversity, sensitive to rare types |
| Normalized H (Pielou J) | H / log₂(n) | 0–1 | Cross-sample evenness comparison |
| Simpson 1-D | 1 − Σ pᵢ² | 0–1 | Dominance probability, robust to rare types |

Normalized H interpretation guide:

| Range | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 0.0–0.3 | Single feature type strongly dominates (e.g. rRNA contamination) |
| 0.3–0.6 | Moderate dominance, limited diversity |
| 0.6–0.8 | Broad, healthy sRNA library — typical of good quality data |
| 0.8–1.0 | Near-even distribution — verify library preparation quality |

### Beta diversity (between-sample)

| Metric | Formula | Range | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Whittaker beta | γ / mean(α) − 1 | 0 → n−1 | Feature type turnover across all samples |
| Bray-Curtis | Σ\|p₁ₖ−p₂ₖ\| / Σ(p₁ₖ+p₂ₖ) | 0–1 | Ordination, clustering, widely understood |
| Aitchison | Euclidean in CLR space | 0 → ∞ | Statistically rigorous for compositional data |

The **Aitchison distance** is a great primary metric for PERMANOVA and ordination. Use **Bray-Curtis** as a supplementary metric for downstream visualization.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**`unknown` feature types in diversity output**

Caused by a mismatch between FASTA headers and BAM reference names. FASTA headers containing whitespace are truncated by bowtie2 at the first space when written to the BAM. Ensure `build_combined_annot_index.nf` has run fresh (not from cache) after any annotation changes, and that stale `QUANTIFY_SRNA_DIVERSITY` and `MERGE_DIVERSITY_OUTPUTS` work directories have been cleared.

```bash
find work/ -name "*_srna_diversity.tsv" | grep -v "all_samples" | \
    xargs -I{} dirname {} | sort -u | xargs rm -rf
find work/ -name "all_samples_*.tsv" | \
    xargs -I{} dirname {} | sort -u | xargs rm -rf
```

**`genome_rRNA` or `genome_tRNA` feature labels**

Caused by an inconsistency in `sample_id` stripping between `annotate_tRNA`/`annotate_rRNA` (which emit `sample_id` with `_genome` suffix) and `portAnnotations` (which strips it). Clear the `BUILD_COMBINED_ANNOT_INDEX` cache:

```bash
find work/ -name "*_bowtie_build.log" | \
    xargs -I{} dirname {} | sort -u | xargs rm -rf
```

**`samtools sort: failed to read header from "-"`**

bowtie2 produced no output. The usual cause is the index was not staged correctly into the `ALIGN_TO_COMBINED_ANNOTATIONS` work directory. Check that the `index/` subdirectory is populated:

```bash
find work/ -name "*_bowtie2_stats.txt" | head -1 | \
    xargs dirname | xargs -I{} ls -la {}/index/
```

**`^M` characters in output files**

Windows-style line endings in input or output files. Fixed by the `.strip()` calls in `merge_diversity_outputs.py`. If they persist, convert files manually:

```bash
sed -i 's/\r//' results/06_srna_diversity/all_samples_*.tsv
```

**Pipeline cached incorrectly after code changes**

If a process uses a script from `bin/` that was modified after the process last ran, Nextflow will not automatically detect the change and may use cached results. Clear the relevant process work directories manually before rerunning with `-resume`.

**Large genome index build failure (Lsa)**

Reasonably large genomes (~2.7 Gb) may exceed standard bowtie2 index limits. The pipeline automatically retries with `--large-index`. If this fails, check available disk space (large indices require ~20 GB) and RAM (≥48 GB required).

### Verifying combined FASTA labels before a full run

After `BUILD_COMBINED_ANNOT_INDEX` completes, verify feature labels are correct before the alignment step proceeds:

```bash
find work/ -name "*_bowtie_build.log" | \
    while read log; do
        dir=$(dirname $log)
        fa=$(ls $dir/*_combined.fa 2>/dev/null | head -1)
        if [ -n "$fa" ]; then
            echo "=== $(basename $fa) ==="
            grep "^>" $fa | awk -F'|' '{print $1}' | sort -u
        fi
    done
```

Expected output for each organism:

```
>cDNA
>hairpin
>miRNA
>rRNA
>TE
>tRNA
>...

```
